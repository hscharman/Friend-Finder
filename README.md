# Friend Finder App

## Description
Friend Finder is an application that finds a friend match for the user based on their answers to a ten-question survey. The user's responses are compared to an array of existing "friends", and the closest matching friend is returned. 

The application uses a Node.js and Express server on the back-end and simple Bootstrap CSS on the front-end. The JavaScript plugin Chosen is also utilized to make the select boxes on the survey questions more user-friendly.
